       <!-- 1) Young Royals -->
        <div class="thumbnail" onclick="openModal('Young Royals (2021)', '<b>Background:</b> Young Royals is a Swedish teen television show that centers around the Swedish Prince Wilhelm and his love interest, Simon Eriksson. The two meet at a boarding school and develop a close romantic relationship. Their romance is outed when a student leaks an intimate video of them online. Due to Wilhelm\'s royal status and social class, their relationship is seen as taboo. Wilhelm is subsequently forced to deny both his involvement in the video and his relationship with Simon.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (Realistic):</b> The portrayal of Wilhelm and Simon\'s relationship resonates deeply with audiences because it avoids common queer media tropes. Unlike stories with dramatic \'coming-out\' moments or characters who suffer identity crises, Young Royals presents two individuals who are already comfortable with their sexuality. Instead, their conflict stems from external pressures like class dynamics and family expectations. Fans particularly appreciate the subtle and realistic depiction of romance that are often expressed through small gestures like glances, hugs, and hand-holding. This portrayal highlights that their love is natural, and the tension arises from societal power structures, which adds realism to the show. Sweden\'s progressive stance as one of the first countries to legalize same-sex marriage further complements this nuanced depiction.', 'movie1.png')">

        <!-- 2) Call Me by Your Name -->
        <div class="thumbnail" onclick="openModal('Call Me by Your Name (2017)', '<b>Background:</b> Call Me By Your Name is a widely recognized queer film set in 1983 Northern Italy. It follows 17-year-old Elio and 24-year-old Oliver as they slowly transition from casual acquaintances to romantic partners over a summer. At the film\'s start, both characters are seen pursuing relationships with women before their romance takes center stage (Elio with Marzia and Oliver with various local women).<br></br><b>Audience Reactions(\'Problematic\'):</b> While the film is celebrated for its beauty and emotional depth, it has drawn significant criticism because of the age gap between Elio (17) and Oliver (24). Many argue that such a dynamic would not be celebrated in a heterosexual context. It raised concerns about double standards and the ethical implications of portraying a teenager in a relationship with an adult. Additionally, some critics feel the film romanticizes queerness as a fleeting, nostalgic experience rather than treating it as a fully realized identity.<br></br>The movie has also been critiqued for catering to the \'female gaze,\' with one online writer describing it as \'bicurious sensitive men living carefree lives in the Mediterranean.\' Furthermore, it reinforces the \'tragic gay romance\' trope, where queer relationships end in separation or heartbreak.', 'movie8.png')">

        <div class="thumbnail" onclick="openModal('But I\'m a Cheerleader (1999)', '<b>Background:</b> But I\'m a Cheerleader (1999) is a satirical comedy about Megan, a high school cheerleader sent to a conversion therapy camp by her conservative parents. This is where she meets Graham, a confident and self-assured lesbian who helps Megan accept her identity and embrace her sexuality.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (\'Stereotypical but Not Stereotyped\'):</b> Audiences have embraced But I\'m a Cheerleader for its unique blend of humor, satire, and social commentary. The film cleverly highlights the absurdity and hypocrisy of conversion therapy while addressing broader themes of gender roles and sexuality. Although the movie leans heavily into stereotypes (e.g., feminine cheerleaders and butch lesbians) for comedic effect. However, it eventually subverts those same stereotypes by showing that queerness transcends appearances or behavior. For example, Megan\'s character, a \'typical\' straight-presenting cheerleader, helps challenge assumptions about what being queer looks like.<br></br>The film\'s satirical tone frames homophobic beliefs as outdated and ridiculous, making it both lighthearted and empowering. Now considered a \'cult classic,\' But I\'m a Cheerleader continues to resonate with audiences for its progressive themes and unapologetic celebration of queer identity.<br></br><b>Connection to Class:</b> In Jacqui Alexander\'s Not Just Anybody, she states that \'some bodies have been marked by the state as non-procreative, in pursuit of sex only for pleasure, a sex that is non-productive of babies and of no economic gain.\' This idea reflects Megan\'s family\'s reaction to her sexuality—they view it as unnatural and a threat to societal norms. Similarly, the conversion camp enforces heteronormative ideals, assigning housewife-like roles to girls as part of its \'corrective\' methods.', 'movie3.png')">

        <!-- 4) Bridgerton -->
        <div class="thumbnail" onclick="openModal('Bridgerton (2020)', '<b>Background:</b> Bridgerton is a Netflix period drama based on Julia Quinn\'s book series. The show explores the romantic lives of the Bridgerton siblings in early 1800s England. While the books lack any queer relationships, the TV adaptation takes a modern approach by introducing queerness. In Season 1, Benedict Bridgerton is briefly given a male love interest but this storyline is largely abandoned in subsequent seasons.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (\'Queer Baiting\'):</b> Fans have criticized Bridgerton for \'queer baiting\'—the practice of hinting at queer storylines without committing to meaningful representation. In Season 1, Benedict\'s relationship with a man is depicted, but by Season 2 Benedict is shown exclusively pursuing women. The lack of resolution or conflict regarding his sexuality disappointed viewers, particularly given the challenges queer individuals would likely face in the 1800s.<br></br>This pattern continues in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, where a queer subplot between Brimsley and Reynolds ends without closure. While fans believe Benedict is bisexual, many feel his earlier storyline was merely a diversion rather than a meaningful exploration of his identity. Fans argue that queer characters in Bridgerton remain sidelined and are rarely treated as central narratives.', 'movie4.png')">

        <!-- 5) Sex and The City -->
        <div class="thumbnail" onclick="openModal('Sex and The City (1998)', '<b>Background:</b> Sex and the City follows four women, Carrie Bradshaw, Charlotte York, Miranda Hobbes, and Samantha Jones, as they navigate love, careers, and friendships in late 1990s/early 2000s New York City. The show features two notable queer moments: when Carrie dates a bisexual man and when Samantha briefly dates a woman.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (\'Bi-Erasure\'):</b> While Sex and the City was groundbreaking for its time, its treatment of bisexuality has aged poorly. In Carrie\'s storyline, she is visibly uncomfortable with her boyfriend\'s bisexuality and questions its validity. The episode frames her perspective as \'right,\' reinforcing harmful stereotypes that bisexuality is \'just a phase.\' Similarly, when Samantha dates a woman, her friends dismiss her sexuality, claiming she\'s \'run out of men\' to date.<br></br>These moments reflect a broader bi-erasure in media, where bisexuality is portrayed as promiscuous and indecisive. Although Sex and the City aimed to present progressive, liberated women, these instances highlight the show\'s shortcomings in embracing diverse identities.<br></br><b>Connection to Class:</b> In Oppressed Shall Not Become the Oppressor by TWGR, it states, \'Sisters quickly fall in line behind their men… by your anti-homosexual stance you have used the weapons of the oppressor thereby becoming the agent of the oppressor.\' This critique is evident in Sex and the City: despite the characters\' progressive personas, their homophobic and bi-erasing attitudes align them with oppressive systems they otherwise claim to resist.', 'movie5.png')">

The story follows a dysfunctional family of seven adopted and superpowered children who reunite as adults to prevent apocalyptic events. In the show, Vanya Hargreeves was portrayed by Elliot Page before his transition and is later reintroduced as Viktor Hargreeves in Season 3. The writers integrated Viktor\'s transition seamlessly to reflect Page\'s real-life journey without excessive explanation. Instead of dramatizing the change, the writers approached it naturally and affirmed both the character and the actor.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (Transitioning):</b> The decision to align Viktor\'s storyline with Elliot Page\'s transition sparked mixed reactions. Many fans praised the writers for handling the transition with subtlety since it reflected the reality of many trans people and emphasized that transitions do not always have to be the central focus of their lives. However, there was some critique of Viktor\'s introduction scene, where he is described as someone who has \'gone through every girl in the town.\' Fans found this characterization inconsistent with Viktor\'s previous behavior, interpreting it as a clumsy attempt to solidify his masculinity post-transition. Still, Viktor\'s story, alongside Klaus (who is pansexual), reinforces The Umbrella Academy as a show that celebrates queer identities in diverse ways.', 'movie6.png')">

It tells the story of Alex Claremont-Diaz, the First Son of the United States, and Prince Henry of the British royal family. Their relationship begins with rivalry and evolves into a secret romance. However, this is complicated by Alex\'s mother running for re-election and Henry\'s royal duties. When their private messages are leaked, their relationship is forcibly outed, prompting backlash from both the White House and the British monarchy. However, public support ultimately overturns institutional resistance, affirming their love in a highly political and public context.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (\'Female Gaze\'):</b> The film faced criticism for its overly idealistic portrayal of a queer relationship in the public eye. Many critics argue that it sidesteps real-world challenges like homophobia and systemic oppression. Instead, it portrays a utopian outcome that feels detached from reality. Additionally, some have pointed out that the story, written by a female author, caters largely to straight female audiences. It emphasizes romantic tropes over multidimensional queer representation.<br></br>Nevertheless, many fans defend the film as a lighthearted fantasy rather than a political commentary. For them, Red, White & Royal Blue serves as escapism or a space where queer love can exist without constant struggle or trauma.<br></br><b>Connection to Class:</b> In the preface to If They Come in the Morning by Davis and Aptheker, the authors describe repression as \'the response of an increasingly desperate imperialist ruling clique to contain an otherwise uncontrollable and growing popular disaffection.\' This resonates with Red, White & Royal Blue, where Alex and Henry are both privileged figures from powerful ruling-class institutions who find their relationship stifled by those same systems. Yet, public support ultimately challenges and transforms these institutions, reflecting how power can shift when collective voices demand change.', 'movie2.png')">

The show is known for its inclusive portrayal of teenage sexuality and its diverse, nuanced queer characters. Key queer characters include Eric Effiong (Otis\'s best friend), Adam Groff (Eric\'s love interest), Ola Nyman (who identifies as pansexual), and Cal Bowman (a nonbinary character introduced later in the series).<br></br>The show\'s realistic and unfiltered approach to teenage sexual exploration and identity made it groundbreaking, as it depicts queer stories with sensitivity, humor, and honesty.<br></br><b>Connection to Class:</b> In Blackheart 2: The Prison Issue, the metaphor of a \'prison\' is used to describe how Black gay men are often constrained by societal expectations, stating, \'Many Black gay men find ourselves in prisons of our own making… we tacitly allow others to define us and our issues.\' This metaphor reflects Eric Effiong\'s storyline in Sex Education. As a gay, Black, religious teenager from an immigrant family, Eric navigates layers of internalized shame and external pressure. Initially, Eric suppresses parts of himself due to his family\'s beliefs and his religious upbringing. However, through his relationships, self-expression, and acts of defiance, like wearing bold clothing and makeup, Eric breaks free from these metaphorical \'prisons.\' His arc highlights the intersection of race, religion, and queerness, affirming that self-acceptance is both a personal and political journey.', 'movie9.png')">

The series follows Erin, Orla, Clare, Michelle, and James as they navigate Catholic school, teenage rebellion, and the backdrop of political unrest. Themes of Catholicism, generational conflict, and friendship are central to the show\'s humor and heart.<br></br>In Season 1, Clare comes out as a lesbian after an anonymous story she wrote is publicly revealed at school. This accidental outing pressures Clare to disclose her sexuality to her friends. Their initial reactions range from dismissal to awkward acceptance, particularly with Erin\'s comedic denial of Clare\'s identity. However, the group quickly reconciles, and Clare\'s sexuality is ultimately treated with warmth and normalcy—different, but not wrong.<br></br><b>Audience Reactions (\'Underdeveloped or Accurate Portrayal?\'):</b> Some viewers criticized the show for underdeveloping Clare\'s storyline, arguing that her sexuality could have been explored further. However, others found this subtlety to be part of the show\'s charm. Clare\'s coming out does not become the defining feature of her character; she remains the same loyal, neurotic, and funny friend. Therefore, her sexuality exists as a part of her, not the totality of her identity.<br></br><b>Connection to Class:</b> In DYKETACTICS by Paola Bacchetta, the author discusses the silencing and dismissal often faced by lesbians, recounting how she was once told, \'You\'re young now, and you identify as a lesbian. Let\'s see if that will always be so. Only time will tell.\' This echoes Erin\'s reaction to Clare\'s coming out, where Erin\'s inability to immediately accept Clare reflects a broader societal reluctance to validate queer identities. Although Derry Girls uses this moment for comedic effect, it underscores the real-life challenges of having one\'s identity dismissed or minimized.', 'movie10.png')">
